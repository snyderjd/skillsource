#SkillSource

##Introduction
The internet has become an increasingly popular way for people to learn new skills and technologies. This includes how to accomplish simple tasks such as changing a tire or cooking a meal, all the way to more involved, complex skills such as learning how to program in a particular language or use a certain technology. However, very rarely does one source provide all the information and tools needed to master a particular skill. SkillSource was developed as a tool for users to plan, document, and track their progress toward learning a particular skill as well as seeing what resources others have used to master the skill they wish to learn.

### SkillSource allows users to do the following:
* Add, edit, and delete skills
* Add, edit, and delete resources(videos, courses, articles, etc.) for any of their skills
* Includes a progress bar which updates when users mark a resource as 'complete'
* Search the application to see what other users have learned and which resources they used
* Clone skills that have been created by other users. Users can use the same set of resources or edit the resources to best fit their learning objectives
* Search the web from within the application for videos or other web content and add the results to any of their skills

### Technologies Used
* React
* Javascript
* Reactstrap
* Bootstrap
* JSON Server
* Youtube Data and Google Custom Search APIs

### Setup
* Click 'Clone or Download', and copy the repo's URL
* Paste the repo URL in a terminal with git clone (Ex: 'git clone git@github.com:snyderjd/skillsource.git skillsource')
* cd into skillsource and run 'npm install' to install the required packages and dependencies
* run 'npm start' from the project's root directory and start json-server on port 5002 ('json-server -p 5002 database.json')
